# Memory Game Project

This is a basic Memory Game project as you would know it from your childhood. There are 8 pairs of cards, you win if you find all pairs in less than 70 moves. Your score is displayed in upper left corner in a form of stars and it depends on the amount of moves it took you to win the game.

## Instructions

To play the game download the contents of the repository and open `index.html` in your internet browser. 

## Project contents

The project is structured as followed:

* main folder contains the actual html page with the game, README amd other technical files
* `/css` folder contains the styling of the page
* `/js` folder contains the javascript file describing the mechanics of the game as well as minified version of the jQuery library
* `/img` folder contains the background image

The structure of the folders should be preserved for the website to work properly.

## Bugs

The mechanics of the game is not perfect when the user clicks on cards very fast. Sometimes the recognition of which cards are matched and which are not can get mixed up. Best not to click on cards too fast and wait for the game to change the color of the cards if the match is found.
